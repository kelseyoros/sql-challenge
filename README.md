# sql-challenge

In this task, I complete a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s using the six csv files that remain of the database of employees from that period.

This challenge consists of 2 parts:
1. Data Engineering
	* Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables
	* Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files
	* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.


2. Data Analysis
